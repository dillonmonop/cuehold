## Product positioning

Cuehold helps users capture messy thoughts, screenshots, voice notes, pasted text, and shared content, then triage them into clearer next actions.

It does not replace Apple Reminders or Apple Calendar.

Cuehold helps users decide what matters. Apple Reminders reminds. Apple Calendar maps time.

## Non-negotiables

- Do not imply Apple affiliation.
- Do not call the app a Siri replacement.
- Do not describe it as medical ADHD treatment.
- Do not claim full automation.
- Do not promise silent scheduling.
- Do not expose internal codename language on public pages.
- Do not add paid/subscription messaging yet.
- Keep the website focused on Capture → Triage → What Next.

## Current priority

Keep the public site accurate, simple, mobile-friendly, and ready for external beta preparation without implying public availability.
